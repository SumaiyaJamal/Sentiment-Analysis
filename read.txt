No one can make us happy. We only are responsible for our happiness. Happiness is a choice. True happiness comes when we realize our oneness with God. In order to be happy, one must be grateful to God for the many things he has given us.

We should be happy for such a precious gift called life. Furthermore, It is not necessary to have many big things to be happy. A grateful person finds happiness even in small things in life. We should look at people below us and be thankful. Also, we should be grateful for the eyes. We can see the beautiful world around us.

Moreover, we must be satisfied in life. Hence, to be happy, we should lessen the burden of desires and expectations. We should not always crave for things. If our desires would not be met, we would become sad. Thus, optimism, self-realization, gratitude, and satisfaction are the major keys to happiness.
